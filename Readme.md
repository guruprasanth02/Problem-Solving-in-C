# Problem-Solving-in-C
I have Started Solving Problem in C language, The Programs are below

C Program
1. Write a C program to print the Hello World and its length. [(Code)](https://github.com/guruprasanth02/Problem-Solving-in-C/blob/main/C01/Hello%20world.c)
2. Write a C program to determine the value of sum after the assignment statement. [(Code)](https://github.com/guruprasanth02/Problem-Solving-in-C/blob/main/C02/operators.c)
3. Write a C program to check whether a given number is positive or negative. [(Code)](https://github.com/guruprasanth02/Problem-Solving-in-C/blob/main/C03/number%20is%20positive%20or%20negative.c)
4. Write a C program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not. [(Code)](https://github.com/guruprasanth02/Problem-Solving-in-C/blob/main/C04/Check%20Whether%20two%20numbers%20are%20equal.c)
5. Write a C program to check whether a given number is even or odd. [(Code)](https://github.com/guruprasanth02/Problem-Solving-in-C/blob/main/C05/number%20is%20odd%20or%20even.c)
